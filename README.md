# vfsa_2d

This package demonstrate who one can parametrize a VFSA optimization algorithm for few 2D objective functions.

Simply run this code "vfsa_2d_v01.m" and it will find all the dependencies.

Contribution are welcome to include other objective fucntions. Converting the codes to other programming languages are also welcome.

The current objective functions provided are as follows:

sign function 2D with global minimum at(0,0) where f(x, y)=0.0

Banana(Rosen)function with global minimum at(1,1) where f(x, y)=0.0

Griewank function with global minimum at(0,0) where f(x, y)=0.0
